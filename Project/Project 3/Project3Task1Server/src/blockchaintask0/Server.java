 * This program demonstrates a very simple stand-alone Blockchain.
 * Behind the scenes, there will be a client server interaction
 * using JSON over TCP sockets.
 * Each request to the server must be signed using the
 * private key. The signature must be checked on the
 * server. If the signature fails to verify,
 * send an appropriate error message back to the client.
 *
 * The message transfers in this program is formatted by two JSON messages types
 * â€“ a message to encapsulate requests from the client
 * and a message to encapsulate responses from the server.
 * Each JSON request message will include a signature.
